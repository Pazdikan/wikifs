        p.shitpost I see you're trying to log in to my private website? You dumb imbecile ðŸ’€ I know that this shit is not secure but failing to go through a simple if statement? If you really want to access it, perhaps consider exploring potential exploits or at least use a VPN. By the way, how is the weather in #{ip["country"]}? I've been thinking about moving to #{ip["city"]} lately, but I've heard the internet connection there can be problematic. Have you come across #{ip["asname"]}? Are their services reliable?
