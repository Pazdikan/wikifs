# Installation

Basically copy `src/settings.js.example` to `src/settings.js`, configure everything and start it using `node .`. Leave it on your local network or use some kind of reverse proxy. Hosting this shit on a server (probably not only a server) might be a terrible idea ðŸ’€. I don't know shit about securing this type of apps, but I'll try to read more about some security stuff and try to implement it soon.
